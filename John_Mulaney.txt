John Mulaney

Hi! Hi! Hello!


Hi! Hahaha, how are you? Thank you, that's very nice of you, thank you.


Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's so nice of you, I hope you're having a good week, thank you for being here! I, uh, am doing well myself. In a couple days I'm gonna turn 29 years old and I'm very excited about that. I was hoping, uh, by now that I would look older but that didn't happen.


I don't look older, I just look worse, I think. Honestly, when I'm walking down the street, no one's ever like, "Hey, look at that man!" I think they're just like "Whoa! That tall child looks terrible!" "Get some rest, tall child! You can't keep burning the candle at both ends!"

You ever seen on "America's Most Wanted" when they age a photo of someone? Just take my kindergarten photo and yellow the teeth and put bags under the eyes and be like "This is what he would look like now" 

I was a very nervous kid, I was very anxious all the time when I was younger. But what's nice is that... some of the things I was anxious about don't bother me at all anymore. Like, uhhh, I always thought that, uh, quicksand was gonna be a much bigger problem than it turned out to be.


Because if you watch cartoons, quicksand is like the third biggest thing you have to worry about in adult life, behind real sticks of dynamite and giant anvils falling on you from the sky

I used to sit around and think about what to do about quicksand! I never thought about how to handle real problems in adult life. I was never like, "Oh, what's it gonna be like when relatives ask to borrow money?" 

Now I've gotten older, and not only have I never stepped in quicksand, I've never even heard about it! No one's ever been like, "Ey, if you're comin' to visit, take I-90 'cause I-95 has a little quicksand in the middle. Looks like regular sand, but then you're gonna start to sink into it." 



I was nervous all the time, but I had a good family, I have wonderful parents. A lot of guys my age I'll hear them say this, they'll go, "Every day I think I'm becoming more like my dad". I think I'm becoming more like my mom? Because I- I was watching that show "Access Hollywood" and one of the reporters said, "Up next, we've got an exclusive interview with Sandra Bullock's former husband Jessie James," and out loud, I went, "Euch! This oughta be good!"


That's pure mom.


My parents are both lawyers, they are BOTH lawyers, and sometimes they would be like lawyers with us when we were kids. I remember one time I was in bed, and my dad came in and he said "Good night, John! Did you brush your teeth?" and I said, "Yes", But here's the thing. I hadn't.

But who cares? I didn't have, like, a job interview or anything. So my dad comes back and in a couple minutes holding my toothbrush. He says, "John, is this your toothbrush?" and I said "Yes", and he said, "So we agree that this is your toothbrush?"



But he said, "John this toothbrush is bone-dry." Yea, like he looked down and he said "bone-dry". 

He said, "You lied to me!" and I said "Dad, I did not lie, I said that I brushed my teeth, I never specified that I brushed my teeth tonight!  And if the court reporter reads back my remarks, you will see that I did not perjure myself."

My mom's also a lawyer, she was a different kind of lawyer with us when we were kids. My mom was more like Nancy Grace. She would just make wild accusations all day long and wait for something to stick. 

My mom would blame me for things that happened on the news. That is true.

I woke up one morning when I was a kid and my mom was standing over my bed and said, "I just heard that Princess Diana and her lover Dodi Al-Fayed have been killed in Paris"


Like I had something to do with it! I was like, "Mom, I have been here all night. You can feel the TV, it's warm." Luckily, I had a good alibi since I was in Wisconsin and 12.


My brothers and sisters and I had this babysitter named Veronica when we were kids, and I was in love with her. I was in love with Veronica. She would babysit us on Saturday nights.

And in my head, when I was a little kid, I thought that Veronica was like 25, 30 years old. I was just talking to my mom the other week, I found out that when I was 10 Veronica was 13.


So why was she in charge? All she could do was dial the telephone a little better than I could.

13 when I'm 10? That's just like hiring a slightly bigger child. That would be like if you're going out of town for the week and you paid a horse to watch your dog.



Like, "All right, here is the number where we'll be, and here's where we keep the dog food, and you're a horse." "Shh shh shh shh shh, shh shh shh, shh shh"

Why do people do that? People always shush animals. They'll go, "Hey, shh shh shh..." They've never spoken.

I always wanted to live in New York when I was a kid, I'm so excited that I get to live in New York. I saw New York City in a movie when I was a kid, it was called Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. It is a sequel, Yeah, how about that movie? 

It was a sequel to the movie Home Alone.

I remember in that movie— oh, the kid in Home Alone 2. He gets into a stretch limousine on 5th avenue with a large cheese pizza and I thought, "THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF LUXURY!!"

Now I live in New York and I'm psyched, but that is a stupid movie title. Lost in New York? The streets are numbered. How'd you get lost in New York?

I know it's kind of stupid to complain about a movie that came out 17 years ago, but I wasn't a comedian back then. So I have to do it now. I wish I'd been. I wish I'd been a Def Jam comic when that movie came out. I would have torn it to pieces! Be like, "You seen this shit? You seen this Home Alone 2: Lost in New York shit? It's a grid system, motherfucker! Where you at? 24th and 5th? Where you wanna go? 35th and 6th? 11 up and 1 over, you simple bitch!!"

That'd be my big joke. That'd be the closer. If I was a Def Jam comic when that movie came out. But alas, I was not.

I think the bullying that young people have to go through now is really rough, I really sympathize, 'cause I was bullied when I was a kid. When I was in grade school, I was bullied for being Asian-American. Aaaand, the biggest problem with that... is that I am not Asian-American. 


But when I was younger, and this is absolutely true, people thought that I might be Asian-American. I have pretty thin eyes, I had very thin eyes when I was a little kid and I had straight black hair that I wore in a bowl cut. And from the ages of 3 to 8, people thought that I might be a young Chinese person.

On the first day that he met me, the guy that is now my best friend — he met me the first day of kindergarten — he went home that night and said, "Papa, today I met a boy with no eyes." And that was me.

Kids would make fun of me in middle school. Kids would call me a "china man", which of the racial slurs has got to be the laziest. That is just pushing two words together, no work was done there.

It was very confusing to me because I'm not Chinese, no one in my family is remotely Asian. I mean, we take our shoes off when we come inside, but that was more of a carpeting thing that anything else. 

Here's how bad it got, though... I remember when I was in junior high, we had this music appreciation class that we never appreciated. And they took us to hear some classical music once at a symphony orchestra. So we go to a symphony orchestra. In one of these classical pieces, there is a moment where they bang a gong, and every time they banged the gong, all the kids sitting in front of me would stand up, turn to me, and bow like that. Which is some racist-ass bullshit, but also incredibly well coordinated for a group of 13-year-olds.

13-year-olds are the meanest people in the world. They terrify me to this day. If I'm on the street on like a Friday at 3 PM and I see a group of 8th graders on one side of the street I will cross to the other side of the street. Because 8th graders will make fun of you, but in an accurate way.

They will get to the thing that you don't like about you. They don't even need to look at you for long, they'll just be like, "Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey, look at that high-waisted man! He got feminine hips!"

And I'm like, "No!! That's the thing I'm sensitive about!!!!" 

When I was a boy, I was also confused with a woman sometimes over the phone, because before I went through puberty, I had a voice like a little flute! 

I was once on the telephone with Blockbuster Video, which is a very old-fashioned sentence. And — It is! I was on the telephone with Blockbuster Video... that's like when your gram would be like "We'd all go play jacks down at the soda fountain!" and you're like, "No one knows what you're talking about, you IDIOT."

You know how you talk to your grandma? So... I was on the phone with Blockbuster, and I'd called them a couple of times in one day to ask about a movie, and I called for a third time. I said, "Hey, yeah, I-I was just calling to see if you had Addams Family Values yet," and the guy at Blockbuster went, "Hey lady! I'll tell you when we get Addams Family Values!!"

But look, I wasn't offended as a boy being confused with a lady, I was offended as a lady who was getting pushed around by this chauvinist asshole that works at Blockbuster video, talking to me like I'm some floozy... I am a proud Asian-American woman and you will treat me with respect! I am a tiger mom!

Now when people make fun of me, I deserve it. Uhh, I do. When people get mad at me now, it's my fault, when people get mad at me on the highway that's all my bad, I'm a terrible driver, I know nothing about cars. I meant to learn about cars, and then I forgot. 

Nothing that I know can help you with your car ever. Unless you're like, uh, "Hey I've got a flat tire, does anyone here know a lot about The Cosby Show?" and then I could be like "Oh, perhaps I could be of some assistance."

I'm one of the worst drivers I've ever seen, and I just want you all to know that if you're ever on the highway behind me, uh, I hear you honking and I also don't want me to be doing what I'm doing. I don't like that I'm in that lane either, and I sure would like to get out of it! 

I was on the highway in Texas recently which was like a highway filled with 13-year-olds. And I was in the far left lane and then it turned into a U-turn only lane and I started to make a U-turn but then I panicked because I didn't wanna make a U-turn! So I put the car in reverse and then merged right back onto the highway 

The best thing about that was that after that, cars were pulling up and looking over to see who just did that piece of shit move, expecting to see like a 100-year-old blind dog who's texting while driving and drinking a smoothie, instead they see a 28-year-old healthy man trying his best. 

It's wrong to make fun of people, you know, but it's so fun sometimes. I've written for some TV shows, and, you know, on a major TV show you have to be careful about what you say about people 'cause a lot of people get offended, or so it has been explained to me.

I was once — I'll tell you this, I was writing for an awards show once, and I got into some trouble. I wrote a joke for this awards show that had the word "midget" in it. And someone from the network came down to our offices and he said to me, "Hey, you can't put the word midget on TV," and I said "I sure would like to!" And he said, "No! 'Midget' is as bad as the 'n'-word."

First off, no. No, it's not! "Do you know how I know it's not," I said to him, "is because we're saying the word 'midget', and we're not even saying what the 'n'-word is! If you're comparing the badness of two words, and you won't even say one of them... that's the worse word." 

Also, I don't mean to gloss over what, like, little people have been through in this country, but you cannot compare the plight of midgets to African-Americans. That is outrageous! Midgets were never enslaved, unless you count the Wonka factory! 

So we get into this argument, we're going back and forth, he goes "You can't put that word on TV," and I said, "I want to," and he said "If you put that word on TV, there could be a protest of midgets on this building!" and I said, "Promise?" How tempting would that be?

I don't mean to complain about censorship at all though, because as you probably have seen by now, you can basically say whatever you want on television. It's ridiculous. You can say anything you want! And if you don't believe me, you should watch a little program called Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Yeah. A show that I LOVE, because on that show you can say the grossest things you've ever heard in your life. No, you can't say like the "f"-word, you can't say that on Special Victims Unit, but people walk around on SVU going like, "Looks like the victim had anal contusions. Yo, looks like we found semen and fecal matter in the victim's ear canal." 

Those are two real things that I heard on Law & Order: SVU at 3 in the afternoon, both spoken by Ice-T. Ice-T is a detective with the special victims unit, he handles New York's most sensitive cases.

I love Ice-T on SVU. He is fantastic, he's awesome. What's so great about him is that he's been with the SVU for like, mmm, 11 years now, but he still treats every case like it's his first in terms of total confusion. Sometimes they'll be in the middle of an investigation and Ice-T will be like, "Yo, you telling me this dude gets off on little girls with pigtails?" It's like, "Yeah, Ice. He's a pedophile. You work in the sex crimes division. You're gonna have to get used to that."

You know how they try and tie in, like, current events to every episode of SVU? So there was this episode I saw a while ago that was about sex addiction, 'cause a lot of celebrities have come out as sex addicts. So the episode's about sex addiction. There is a scene in the episode where the other detectives are trying to teach Ice-T what sex addiction is, and it takes a couple of minutes. 

And finally, Ice-T gets it, and they cut to him in this close-up and he goes, "Oh, I get it. You mean like when someone drinks too much, or snorts cocaine, or bets the house on the ponies?"

I was like, "Yeah you got it, man." And I was psyched that Ice-T understood so that they could continue with the investigation, but I could've watched another four hours of Ice-T just naming examples. Just that close-up and Ice-T like, "Or like when some smokes too many cigarettes? Or like when someone shops too much with credit cards? Or like when someone plays too many scratchy lotteries? Or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake? Or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake and then barfs it up?"

And he would just keep talking and it would slowly fade out and say "Executive Producer: Dick Wolf." That'd be my ideal episode. That'd be a good one.

I saw this SVU a little while ago, I saw this episode of SVU, and Dean Cain was a rapist... ON THE SHOW. And there was a scene where they do a line-up with Dean Cain and four other guys and they bring in this woman who's gonna look at the line-up, and it's her behind the glass and they open the curtain and she's standing with the two other detectives. And I knew she wasn't gonna say this, but part of me was hoping she would just be like... "Is that... Dean Cain? Fucking Dean Cain? That's pretty cool."

I also watch this show called Cold Case Files. On Cold Case Files, they solve old murders, and it's really interesting ' cause what I learned from it is that it was really easy to get away with murder before they knew about DNA. It was ridiculously easy. Like, what was even going on back then? What was a murder investigation like in 1935?? One cop would just walk in and be like, "Detective! We found a pool of the killer's blood in that hallway!" and he would just be like "Hmmm... gross! Mop it up. Now then, back to my hunch... Hmmmmmm.... Look for clues. I'll tell you what we'll do! We'll draw chalk around the body is. That way, we'll know where it was..." 

A couple years ago, I saw this movie called Public Enemies with Johnny Depp, it was about old bank robbers and stuff. Here's how easy it was to get away with bank robbery back in the 30's. As long as you weren't still there when the police arrived, you had a 99% chance of getting away with it. To the point that, like, those old bank robbers, they take credit for the bank robberies! Like, they come running out of there and they're like "Ha ha ha! And if anyone asks, you tell em it was Golden Joe and the Suggins Gang!" And then they like shoot "Suggins" into the side of the wall. It's like, what, were bullets free back then? And they don't even disguise themselves! They dress up for the bank robbery. They're rolling in there in, like, big suits and hats like they're going to church in Atlanta. They make a day of it! 

I don't know about that. Oh ho ho! Oh good, it has a mind of its own. That's very reassuring. No, no no no... I don't like robots... thinking of things. 

Hope you don't mind that I dressed up. It was my first communion today so I decided to come right from it.  I was a very good first communicant.

Thank you for coming to this show by the way, I really do apprecaite you coming to a thing because you didn't have to, and it's really easy not to go to things. It is so much easier not to do things than to do them, that you would do anything is totally remarkable.  Percentage-wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them. And so much fun not to do them! Especially when you are supposed to do them. In terms of, like, instant relief, cancelling plans is like heroin.  It is an amazing feeling. Such instant joy.

Kids don't like that. Kids always wanna do stuff. Kids get angry, they go, "Aw, we didn't do anything ALL DAY." You ever ask an adult what they did over the weekend and they say they didn't do anything, their faces light up. Be like, "What'd you do this weekend?" "I, um, I did nothing. I did nothing at all. Did we do anything? No, I didn't do anything." 

I, uh, really do — I was psyched to do it in New York. Uhh, I'm really happy to live here and was glad that we could do it in New York City. And, uh, I'm not sure how you all got here tonight, um, but I did wanna say this, I've never been, uh, killed by hit men so I don't know what it's like in the moments just before you're killed by hit men, but I bet it's not unlike when you're on the subway and you realize that a mariachi band is about to start playing.  Just that brief moment where you're reading and you're like "Oh, a guitar player. Oh, another guitar player. Oh, an accordion player — OOOHH NNNOOOOO" ♬ This is the loudest thing in the world! 

Uh, I was really excited a lot of people, uh, showed up. They told me that it was a big theater and I thought that no one would come. So thank you for coming. I wanted to, like, take ads out in the paper. Like, be — you know, do something to a tot so I get in the New York Post or something. 

Uhh, the New York Post is my favorite newspaper. I think it's great, I read it every day. I like reading the New York Post because reading the New York Post is like talking to someone who heard the news, and now they're trying to give you the gist. It's like, you'd get the same amount of information if you grabbed someone on the street and you were like, "WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?" and they're like, "There's a perv in Queens!" You'd be like, "All right, thank you." 

Or rather, it's like someone read a better newspaper and now they're trying to text you everything they can remember. Doesn't have to be right, just has to be short. I really do love the Post, I read it a lot and there's a hierarchy in the New York Post. Uh, different people that they like and different people that they don't like. Uh, and if you pay attention, you can start to identify some of the rankings that they have.

Um, the number one thing that you can be in the eyes of the New York Post is an angel. An angel is a child who has died. That is the best thing that you can be in the eyes of the New York Post. The less amount of time you live, the better... in the eyes of the Post.

After that, under an angel is a hero. A hero is any man who does his job.  You'll a lot of times see headlines that are like, "Hero Tutor Teaches After School," and you're like "Yeah." 

Down towards the bottom of the spectrum, there are pervs. Pervs touch tots, tots are angels who haven't died yet.  There are no children in the eyes of the New York Post. You're either a tot or you're dead and you're an angel. 

I did leave one out, sorry. Above perv is a bozo.  A bozo is any man who cheats on his wife. That guy's a bozo! 

I remember seeing a headline when Tiger Woods cheated on his wife and it says "Tiger says he's sorry, but Elin says 'Beat it, bozo!'"  No, she did not. She is from another country. And even if she was from this country, no one has said "bozo" in 1,000 years. Who was your source on that, New York Post? Some tiny old lady that chain smokes all day long? They met her in a parking garage and they were like "Madge, give us the scoop! What did Elin say to Tiger?" "Eh, she told him to 'beat it, bozo.'" 


I'm trying to, in general, take better care of myself. I'm trying to stop smoking, I've smoked since I was 13 years old. I started when I was 13 years old 'cause I stole 2 cigarettes from my older sister and I hid them in a shoebox under my bed with a copy of Cosmopolitan Magazine. And one day, my mom cleaned under my bed, and she found the shoebox. I came home from school and my mom was standing there holding it and she said, "Hey mister! I found your treasure!" 

And I never liked the way she phrased that, you know, 'cause that made me sound like the world's lamest pirate. Like, a guy whose treasure chest is two cigarettes and a woman's magazine.  And my dad came home from work, and my mom told my dad that she had cleaned under my bed and found a shoebox with two cigarettes and a Cosmopolitan to which prompted my dad to ask, "How does John know how to make a cosmopolitan?" 

I'm trying to eat better. I was out to lunch with a friend and I got a chicken sandwich and the waitress said to me, "Oh, you're getting a chicken sandwich! Well that comes with a choice of either salad or fries." Those were the choices — salad or fries, the two most different foods in the universe. That's like saying, "What kinda day do you wanna have? Do you wanna be active and go to the bathroom and stuff, or do you wanna lay on the floor moaning?"  "Oh, you're getting a chicken sandwich? Well with that, you can either go for a jog or smoke crack cocaine." "Oh, huh, well... if I get a plate of crack for the table, would you have some? You'd have crack if I got a plate of crack? Yeah, okay, yeah we'll take an order of crack." 

Sometimes when people order fries, they act like it's a little adventure. They'll be like, "Should we get a plate of fries for the table? Should we do it? Should we-should we share some fries?" They gotta make sure that everyone's onboard with it, it's like "If I get fries, you'll have a couple, right? If I get fries for the table, you'll have — I know you'll have fries if I get fries — should we do it? Yeah, let's be bad! C'mon, let's do it, all right, we're gonna take a plate of fries!" It's like a group of couples agreeing to do ecstasy together. 

I have a girlfriend now, uh, myself, which is weird because I'm probably gay based on the way I act and behave and...  have walked and talked for 28 years. I think I was supposed to be gay. I think, like, in Heaven they built, like, three quarters of a gay person and then they forgot to flip the final switch, and they just sent me out and it was like, "You marked that one gay, right?" and it was like, "Oh no! Was I supposed to?"  and they were like, "Oh man, well this'll be a very interesting person.  This'll be a very silly person." 

I was definitely gay when I was a little boy. A lot of little boys are gay. You know, they're very flowy and they have very hard opinions on things.  I don't mean that I was a sexually active gay man when I was a little boy, that's not what I mean. When I was a little boy, I was more like a 67-year-old gay man that's kind of over it sexually, you know. I was just like an old queen, I would just come out of the recess yard and be like, "Everyone get outta my way,  I just wanna sit here and feed my birds." The gym teacher would tell me to play kickball and I'd be like, "You want me to do whaaaat?" 

Real quick, this happened pretty recently, I was in a restaurant near here in the West Village and I was at the urinal and an old gay man came in the bathroom with a walker like this and he said this to me, he went, "I'm either having a drink or I have to pee, you're livin' the golden years, kid, not me," like, he spoke in rhymes, it was crazy.  It was such a weird interaction that I wasn't sure if it actually happened. I came out of the bathroom and I asked my girlfriend, I was like, "Did you see, like, an old man follow me in the bathroom?" and she was like "John, that bathroom's been closed for forty years!"  Whooooooaaaa!!! Whoooooooaaaaaa!!!! 

Where was I? I'm not gay, but I might be, and I have a girlfriend, aaand she's a female person. It's going very well, I love her very much, and so a few months ago she was like, "Okay, it's going well, so now I should meet your parents." Because that what people do when a relationship is going well. They meet each other's parents, and I've never understood that. I've never been with my girlfriend and thought like, "Oh, honey, tonight is going great, but do you know what would make it perfect?  Charles and Ellen Mulaney. Come on! Let's get them in the mix. We've been going pretty hot and heavy lately, I think it's time we bring in two older Catholic people." 

My girlfriend's a female and I had all these friends that were female. So when I started dating her I was like "oh great, they'll all get along... no." Not even a little at the beginning. I don't want to make any generalizations about women because I don't know shit about women, but if there is one thing I've learned in my personal experience is that I think women can be friends with each other, but I think it can be tricky sometimes when you force women to hang out with each other. I think that sometimes doesn't work.

Like, I don't think that you could ever put together a heist with women. Does that make sense? Oceans eleven with women would never work! Cause' two would keep breaking off and start talking shit about the other nine. Or not even talk shit, just say weird passive aggressive things while they break into the casino. Just be like: "Aww, I love how you just wear anything."

My girlfriend is wonderful though. I listen to everything my girlfriend says. I don't mean she bosses me around, I just listen to everything she says because before I had a girlfriend, I never had someone whose always standing next to me who can just point out obvious things that are happening.

Like we'll be in a restaurant and my girlfriend will be like: "you ordered your food an hour ago. It should be here by now" and I'm like "yeahhh it should!" It's like having a lawyer for everyday life. She'll be like: "the bus driver shouldn't talk to you in that way" and I'm like: "no he shouldn't!". Before I had a girlfriend, I had no standard of how I should be treated as a human being. You could do anything to me and I was just like a young Motown singer. I was like shiny and dumb and easy to trick. I'm like: "aww man, you're gonna give me a whole hundred dollas for all of my songs? Where do I sign Mr. Berry Gordy?" And now when I'm not with my girlfriend you can still do anything to me. I can tolerate any treatment.

Like I try to travel alone sometimes you know and I'll put up with anything. Like I'll book a ticket on some garbage airline. You know I don't want to name any actual airline so lets just make one up and so lets just call it delta airlines. So I've got my ticket at "Delta Airlines" and I show up at the airport. "Can I get on the plane now please?" And they're like: "NO! ITS BEEN DELAYED 9 HOURS!" and I go "Okayyy" and I go to the bathroom. Then I come out of the bathroom and I go: "any updates?" and they go: "yeah, we took off while you were in the bathroom. BECAUSE WE HATE YOU. Now take this meal voucher that doesn't work, GO! FETCH!" And I go: "Okayyyyy" and I go over to the Wolfgang puck express and am like: "Can I have a sandwich please?" and they go: "NOOOOOOOOO!" and I go: "Okayyyyyy" and they go: "You're a little fat girl aren't you?" and I go: "noooo! Noooo!" and they go: "Say it!" and I go: "I'm a little fat girl." And then I go over to the Delta help desk, which is an oxymoron and I go: "Can I please go home on an airplane?" and they go: "Nooooo! In fact, we're gonna frame you for murder! And you're gonna go to jail for 30 years!" and I go: "Why are you doing this to me?" and they go: "Because we're Delta Airlines: life is a fucking nightmare!" But with my girlfriend she would be like: "Let's see if Southwest has any flights?" So it's better... 

My girlfriend is a Jewish woman, which is I did on purpose.  Uhhhh, that sounded creepy. I don't mean like: "ahhh I got one!" I mean I... I... I'm not Jewish, but I've always liked Jewish people. I just like them a lot. And I really like dating Jewish women. They're great! Because I think what a lot of people have in relationships is communication cause guys don't know what women are thinking. And with Jewish women you don't have to guess what they are thinking. They will tell you. Yeah, this is going to get playfully anti-Semitic so just allow it to go there. I'll get in trouble, you won't. I really do mean this though I... I really admire that Jewish people, in my own personal experience, have, are very up front with their feelings. They're very... they're very vocal about their thoughts and feelings and I just think that's really admirable.

You know, I'm Irish, and Irish people won't tell you a thing. Irish people keep it so bottled up you know? Like the thing with Irish people is: "I'll just keep all my emotions right here and then one day, I'll die." Like in Ireland it's like: "oh your boy, he died." And it's like: "Alright bury the boy, do it bury the boy. Burry the boyyyyy."  Irish people don't want comfort. Look at a sweater made in Ireland. Its like a turtleneck made out of "Brillo" pads. I used to date gentile women and... ... ... I dated this girl she used to stare out the window all day long and I'm like, what's wrong? And she'd be like: "you wouldn't even understand if I told you." What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?!? 

My Jewish girlfriend and I don't have to guess what's wrong! She comes in the room and... and then we can move on from there. That's what I mean. She's very focused. She's very in the moment, you know. And that's a good thing in a significant other. She's very present. Jews don't daydream, 'cause folks are after 'em and they gotta stay sharp, you know what I mean? They have to be there. They haven't let their minds wander since Egypt. They just stay sharp. They go: "Who's that? Who are you? What's that? What's that over there? Don't do that!" 

"I'm Irish... I keep things very bottled up, and I don't drink. Which is not what you're supposed to do when you're Irish. I don't drink. I used to drink and then I drank too much and I had to stop. That surprises a lot of audiences because I don't look like someone who used to do anything. I look like I was just sitting in a room in a chair eating Saltines for like 28 years and then I walked right out here. But I did, I used to drink a lot and then I stopped. I don't know if anyone here is thinking about quitting drinking but you need to know 2 things if you're thinking of quitting drinking.

The first is that when you stop drinking and you still go to parties where people are drinking, they will have no idea what to offer you. Like once people start drinking for the night, they forget everything that isn't alcohol. Like I'll show up at a party and they'll be like: "Hey everybody! Alright we got Coronas in the fridge and Oh! Hey! Mulaney! Would you like, like an old turnip we found in the cabinet? Would that be good for you? Would you like that? I know you don't drink. Or my girlfriend left a Nuva Ring in the fridge, would you want that? I know you don't drink!" 

Also if you quit drinking you're about to lose the greatest excuse in your life, which is: "I'm really sorry about last night. I was just too drunk..." That is a get out of jail free card that you don't even realize you've had until you lose it. I can't say that anymore. I can never be like: "Sorry about last night, I was just so drunk." Now I have to be like: "I'm really sorry about last night, it's just that I'm mean and loud, it probably will happen again." 

Now I, myself — I quit drinking 'cause I used to drink too much and then I would black out and I would "ruin parties"... or so I'm told.  When you do that enough, you black out drinking and you do crazy things, you kind of become like Michael Jackson. Like any story anyone says about you might be true and even you don't know by the end. I saw an interview with Michael Jackson before he died and they were like: "Is it true you bought the elephant man's bones?" And he was like: "I don't know!" Ya know, cause how could he keep track of that? 

So I would hear stories about myself. Here's a story I once heard about me. I guess I was 20 and I was at a party at someone's house and I had blacked out drinking, and someone came out of one of the rooms at this party holding like an old antique bottle with some liquid in it, and they said, "Hey, is this whiskey or perfume?" And apparently I grabbed it, drank all of it, and said: "It's perfume." And it was.

Another story I heard about myself — this one happened in high school. Uh, we had this teacher in high school whose kid went to our high school. His name was Mr. McNamara and his son Jake McNamara went to our high school. He was a sophomore when I was a senior. So he was two years behind me. And Mr. McNamara was an asshole. And one weekend, he and his wife decided to leave town, which you should never do IF YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE!  And Jake McNamara decided to throw a party at the teacher's house. Hooray! And everyone around town heard about it and we all got up individually and thought, "Okay, let's go over there and destroy the place."

I walked into this party. Everyone I had even met was at this party, and everyone was drinking like it was the end of the world.  People were drinking like it was the civil war and a doctor was coming to saw our legs off. It was totally unsupervised; we were like dogs without horses... we were running wild. I walked down... I walked down to the basement, they had a pool table in the basement. One dude took a running start and threw his body onto the pool table and broke it in half. Another kid found out which room was Mr. McNamara's and went upstairs and took a shit ON HIS COMPUTER! So the party was going great.

I'm standing in the basement, and I'm holding a red cup you've seen in movies. And I'm standing there and I'm holding a red cup and I'm starting to black out and I guess someone said like "something something police." and in a brilliant moment of word association, I YELLED "FUCK DA POLICE! FUCK DA POLICE!" And everyone else joined in, 100... drunk... white... children yelling "Fuck da police" with the confidence of guys who have already been to jail and aren't afraid of it anymore. You know, like the: "I served my nickel! You come and take me!" confidence, but white children. 

The reason someone had said "something something police" was because the police were there. So a Chicago police officer walked down the stairs and got to the bottom in the basement and looked out over a sea of drunk toddlers YELLING: "FUCK THE POLICE" In his face. He was almost impressed. He was like "WOW." And then he leaned into his walkie-talkie and my friend john, who is now a father — this man now has a baby — he grabbed a 40, smashed it on the ground and yelled: "SCATTER!!"

And everyone ran in a different direction. We all ran in different directions. It was like that scene in "Ratatouille" when the humans come in the kitchen and all the rats go in different ways. We all ran in different directions, I ran into the laundry room and I jumped up on the washing machine and I crawled out through a window into the backyard and now I'm running through the backyard and there was this big chain link fence and I thought I've never climbed a fence that high before. And then I woke up at home.

On Monday, I went to school, cause that's what we did back then.  And I'm walking into the school building and who do I see but Jake McNamara. And he says to me "hey, were you at my party on Saturday?" and I was like: "No" you know, like a liar. And he said things really got out of hand: "Someone broke the pool table, someone took a shit on my dad's computer, But the worst thing" he says — "the worst thing is that someone stole these old antique photos of my grandmother and my parents are freaking out about it." and I had that thought that only blackout drunks and Steve Urkel can have: "Did I do that?"

I figured no, I would never do that. I was never sure until two years later... relax. I'm playing video games with this kid named Alex that we also went to high school with. Two years later, we've graduated by now. We're playing video games for a couple hours, and then Alex says to me, "Hey, come here. I want to show you something." And he takes me into his bedroom and then he takes me into a side room off of his bedroom. Never a good thing to have. And he shows me a tiny room that is covered wall to wall in stolen antique photos from different people's parties over the years. And I said: "Why? Why do you do this?" and Alex said "Cause it's the one thing you can't replace." That's the end of that story but how fucked up is that? That's crazy! 

So I don't drink anymore... and its weird you know? I miss it sometimes because drinking can kind of calm your nerves and I live in New York now and sometimes you can see things that will make you anxious you'll see troubling things out on the street. I was coming into my apartment building one night and I saw in front of my building a wheel chair, knocked in its side with no one in it. That's a bad thing to see. Something happened there... you hope it was a miracle... but probably not... probably something worse. 

And I don't like argument, some people like to argue, you know? They think it's like an art. And I don't like it, I think its because really ordinary arguments can get really dramatic really quickly. Like I was talking to a friend recently, and I told him I didn't think I believed in the death penalty, and my friend said to me: "oh, so you're telling me, that if you saw Hitler... walking down the street... you wouldn't kill him?" That wasn't what I was telling you, but alright, lets talk about this entirely new topic. What would I do if I saw Adolf Hitler just walking down the street? Well first off I wanted to know what did my friend mean? Did he mean I see a guy in like the military outfit with the little moustache, cause then I would assume that's someone dressed up as Hitler.  I'm not gonna kill that guy. I'm not gonna kill an actor and ruin Indiana Jones 5 just cause I don't understand costumes. Or does he mean I'm walking down the street and I see like an old old man who I think might be Hitler based on my memory of what Hitler looks like. I'm not gonna kill that guy either, because I am often wrong. I'd murder him and people would be like: "Woah! You just killed an old old man!" and I'd be like: "he looked like Hitler!" and they're like: "Yeah, a little..." 

I have a lot of strange interactions on the street. Years ago, I was walking down the street and a homeless guy came up to me. And he walked up to me he pushed me like that, he pushed me in the chest. And then he said these things in this order. He pushed me and he said: "Excuse me, I am homeless, I am gay, I have aids, I'm new in town." You're gonna close with "New in town?" that is not the most dramatic thing you just said. As they said in the movie Jerry McGuire: "You had me at AIDS." Here's how I would've ordered those things, I would've said: "Excuse me, I'm new in town, and it gets worse." Didn't that guy practice his like pitch at all in the mirror that morning and just figure out what he was gonna say? Ya know in the morning ya know just be like: "Alright now what am I gonna do today, what am I gonna do tonight? Imma walk up and say hello, no that's too subtle imma push him. Imma push him. And I'm gonna say I'm new in town, no no hold back hold back. Save it. Build to that. I'm about to walk up to him, imma push him and go I HAVE AIDSSSS, no that's too strong... alright. Imma walk up to him, push him and start with the fact that I am homeless, as that is a given. Then for back story I will pepper in the fact that I am gay." 

Which I know its tough for gay youth on the street, but that's not like a reason for money. You can't be like, hey would you help me out I'm very gay? Like a few dollars... I always love how he phrased it by the way. He never mentioned living on the street, he said I'm new in town, like it was intriguing. Like he wanted me to set him up with somebody. Like I have a friend whose like: "There's no single guys left in Manhattan." And I'm like: "I know someone whose new in town." "What are 3 other things about him?" 

I decided to do something about this anxiety recently. I decided I was gonna try and get a Xanax prescription. I don't know if anyone here has ever tried Xanax, but its fantastic. Very muted claps for Xanax. You don't really get woos, its more like yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh. I didn't know how to get a Xanax prescription though, drugs like that a tricky sometimes, but I talked to a friend of mine and he said oh yeah, I did this. He said that he had a regular doctor's appointment and at the end of it he said to his doctor: "Hey doctor, sometimes I get nervous on airplanes." And the doctor just wrote him a Xanax prescription. And I'm like yeah, that's the type of lowbrow shit I'm looking for. I'll take your advice, friend I've never listened to before. 

So I go to a clinic, and I go in and I'm just going to go in for you know a regular type of check up and at the end, I'll ask about Xanax. So I get to the front desk, and they have a "why are you here sheet." And I wanna pick something that will get me out really quickly. And I look down and I see frequent urination. And I was like, perfect that'll be a super quick visit you know? I'll just be like hey, sometimes I pee a lot and the doctor would be like: "Me too, crazy right?!?" And I'll be like: "I get nervous on airplanes." So I checked off frequent urination and I sat down in the waiting area and I waited for 3 hours. I finally go back to the observation room and oh! In the observation room there was a male nurse standing there and he has a Batman sticker on his stethoscope, a Batman necklace and a Batman watch. He was kind of moving around the whole time, he was just like: "alright! I am too blessed to be stressed! Lets do it! What are you allergic to, besides work?" and then he'd take something and throw it over his shoulder and be like: "Beats working." And all of his jokes were anti work, which is not always what you want from a health care professional. 

The doctor comes in the room and the doctor looks at my chart and he says: "Oh, you're here for frequent urination, how many times a day are you urinating?" And I tried to think of a number that would warrant a doctor visit. So I said 11. That was too many times to say. The doctor looked at me and said: "You're peeing 11 time a day? Then you may have something wrong with your prostate. So, what we need to do..." Some of you are ahead of me. So I don't know exactly how he phrased it, but the gist of it was: "Hey, if this visit was to continue, I'm going to stick part of my hand up your ass. And I didn't know what to say. Cause I couldn't be like: "No that's okay, I was lying. It was a lie... to get drugs. You know? Like a crime!" So what I did was, I pulled down my pants, walked over to the observation table and I put my hand on the observation table like this and by the way, part of me was like: "Whatever... you know? You ever have those days where you're like: "This might as well happen. Adult life is already so God damn weird." 

So I'm bent over like this on the table, and the doctor comes up behind me and says " no no no, not on your hands, your elbows" and he knocks me down like that. And this is so much worse than this. I don't know why, I think its cause this has a little remaining dignity to it, you know what I mean? This is sort of like, go stick it in, I am an American. This is like you're leaning over the edge of a cruise ship and you're like: "ahhh we're approaching Martinique!" he knocked me down to my elbows and then, he stuck his hand in. and you know how sometimes you're like, I bet I know what most things feel like ya know? You just think you'll know? I did not know, what this was gonna feel like. And this was the actual sound I made, I went: "ooooooohhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmm." But I didn't say it, like it came from my vocal chords but it was totally involuntary. It was as if a ghost had been trapped in my belly and finally flew out towards the light. And then, when he pulled his hand out, we had gotten to know each other pretty well, so I'll phrase this a delicately as a can. I didn't not realize than when the doctor pulls his hand out it feels like your shitting cause the only thing to come out of your butt before has been shit. 

So, he pulls his hand out and I thought I was shitting into his hand. So I yelled: "I'M SORRYY!" This is a very routine procedure by the way for most doctors. And so far he's had to deal with "OHHHHHMMMM" and "I'M SORRYY!"  And he didn't even let me off the hook you know? He wasn't like: "Oh don't worry, you didn't shit into my hand." He just threw his glove away and went "Ahhhwahhhahwa." And I was about to ask about Xanax but he was like: "Alright your prostate's fine but we still need to do a blood test." So I pulled up my pants and shuffled away, feeling different. And he yells out into the hall, he goes: "Hey! We're doing a blood test in here. Get in here!" Batman dances back in and he's like: "Alright, we gonna do a blood test. You look different, let's do it." The doctor left the room, so I'm alone with Batman. I just need this blood test to be over. But first I had to tell Batman something, I was like "Batman look, I'm one of those people who, when you take blood from me, sometimes I can faint. And I was in the waiting area for 3 hours and I haven't eaten anything all day and I'm really worried I'm gonna faint." And Batman said to me, and I'll never forget it: "pshh, you're not gonna faint!"

So, I stick my arm out, Batman puts the needle in my arm, and I'm immediately on the ground. I wake up and I am covered in sweat lying on the observation table. I wake up, I open my eyes and I see Batman's face. He's looking at me and he goes: "you gotta go!" and I go: "Can I please talk to the doctor though for a sec because sometimes, I get nervous on airplanes." And Batman said: "the doctor's gone!" so I got my stuff... and I left. The moral of the story is... that if you've been nervous your entire life, you should ask your doctor about Xanax because if you lie to him, he will stick his finger in your ass. And if you do suffer from frequent urination, keep it to yourself. I went to that clinic 2 years later for a different checkup and as I was leaving, who do I run into but Batman. And he smiled at me and he was wearing reading glasses to show that time had passed.

Thanks very much for listening to me, my name is John Mulaney. You were really fun, thank you. 

All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That's pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you're a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because... No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds... some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So... I don't judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We've all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We've all made a "Happy Birthday" sign... Wait. You get that poster board up, and you're like, "I don't need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass 'H'. Followed by a big-ass 'A' and... Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny 'P' with a high hump, and then we'll put the second 'P' below the hump of that first 'P', sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the 'Y', so I'll do a kind of curled-up noodle 'Y'. Block letters and cursive look good together." And then you go to write "Birthday" and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with "Happy." You're like, "Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass 'B'. Surely more letters will fit in the same space." You're very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we're all violent here, but you're very friendly. No, really. And I don't like confrontation, 'cause I've never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don't give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of... Right away, they're like, "Do not fuck with me." My vibe is more like, "Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I'll probably apologize to you." When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I'm so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. "Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you."

It's been a while since I've been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying "my wife." It sounds so adult. "That's my wife." It's great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna's ticket didn't say anything and my ticket said "priority access." It doesn't matter why. But we were getting on and I said, "Uh, can my wife board with me?" And they were like, "Yes, of course. Right this way." And I was like, "Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, 'Can my girlfriend come?'" And, yeah, I shouldn't have said it that way, but still. "My wife" just has some kick-ass to it, you know? "Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!" Marriage is gonna be very magical. "I didn't kill my wife!" That's like, "Ooh, who's that fella? I bet he did kill his wife." Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That's not really a joke, that's just a little sweet thing I like to say. 'Cause I'd been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don't know if you've ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. 'Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America's Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, "How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?" And then I got cheated on, and I was like, "Oh, okay." "I'm not gonna do it, but I totally get it." And I don't mean in that way of, like, "No one else can have you." I don't care about that. It's just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who's seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can't have them roaming around.

I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" You ever heard that before? It's a bananas insulting expression... to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" You're not allowed to milk a cow that you don't own. That's not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, "Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk." And the farmer was like, "Well, then, this is your cow now." And he was like, "No, no proof of purchase." And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that... you know what that expression means? It means, "Why would you marry a woman if she's already having sex with you?" Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it's like, "Why buy the cow?" Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you're gonna buy it. And... ... you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can't avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. "Why buy the cow?" Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like... And does not enjoy the sale at all... even though she's the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she's especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. "Why buy the cow?" Well, let's be real here. You're very lucky to have the cow that you do have. "Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John." By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and... a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought... They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, "John Mulaney bull?" And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They'll still say it. 'Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but... But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let's be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah... Sure, she's a bossy little Jew, but... ... she takes care of you. And you don't wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, "Hey, you seen any loose milk?"

My wife is Jewish. She's a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don't know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families' religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. "What's the name of the bishop?" "That's actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV's Your Face or Mine?" I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy... And a hush falls over the room. Isn't it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it's like saying, "I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs." No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You'd serve Mass and then you'd serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, "Aw, she's ugly." And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that's awful, but wouldn't you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman's life, and she's walking down the aisle, and the organ's like... And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, "Aw, she's ugly!" Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, "Aw, she's beautiful. She's enchanting."

I grew up Catholic. I don't go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, 'cause you know how you lie to your parents. So... we go into the church and I was like, "I got this under control." And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, "Peace be with you." And everyone said, "And with your spirit." And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, "And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?" For those of you that aren't Catholic, I don't mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but... There's a part in church where the priest says, "Peace be with you." And for many, many years, we all said... – "And also with you." – Very good. But they changed it to "And with your spirit." Because that's what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, "Let's see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No." I'm actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked "And also with you." I always found that clunky. "And also with you." That's not how you talk. – "Have a nice day." – "And also you having one." It's just a little bit wrong, isn't it? It's just a little off. Like, when someone's like, "How are you?" And you're like, "Nothing much." And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with "And also." You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren't expecting it. Like, the priest was like, "Hey, this is the first time we've ever had church. I just wanna say, 'Peace be with you.'" And they were like... "What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some." "Hey, that's good. Let's keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John."

My wife and I don't have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She's a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that's a bulldog, 'cause it's like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, "Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish." She said that. Petunia... Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, "Hey, you're bad at being a dog." So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn't even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, "Oh, okay." Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, "I see what the problem is." She said, "Petunia has become the alpha of the house." And then she pointed at me, she said, "You are no longer the alpha of the house." And in the back of my head, I was like, "I was never the alpha of the house." I turned to my wife, I was like, "Let's pretend. It'll be fun. Yes... My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time." She said, "You need to show dominance over your puppy." These are things people say to me. I said, "How do I do that?" She said, "Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?" I was like, "Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., 'cause she's a foot long and two years old." She said, "No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats." Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. "Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog." She said, "Now, you don't actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you've already eaten." So... for the past month, I shit you not... before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, "Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner." Like we're space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn't work that hard on. "Mmm, we're eating dinner." Meanwhile, Petunia's just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like... "You're not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now."

I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the '20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it's haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn't buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I'm allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, "So, for instance, this is what you'll pay in July of 2029." And I burst out laughing. I was like, "2029? That's not a real year. By 2029, I'll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I'm not gonna be writing you a paper check." I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, 'cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, "Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that's near Craig's job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia's need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig's job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7... let's see what Lori Jo can do on this week's episode of You Don't Deserve A Beach House."

I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. 'Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico's accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they're always, "So excited to see you two." We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She'd go, "Let's talk. Let's talk before we go in." We're, like, two feet from the door. "So, there's no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let's go." So, we'd have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who's just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They'd be like, "Hi, Tony." "Hi, Kim." It's like, "Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?" Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she'd be like, "So, this could be an office." "Or maybe a nursery." "Yeah. No, like we said, we don't know if we're gonna have... " "No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don't know if you're gonna have 'em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don't know what's gonna happen, and then... you know, something happens." "Well, yeah, that's how all of life works." "Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery." She showed me a backyard once. She goes, "I don't even like this backyard for you." I was like, "Oh, do tell." She said, "It's all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple... little guys... running around in the grass." And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, "Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that's my wife!"

I didn't mean to make it sound like we don't want children. We don't, but I didn't mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don't think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don't care for that shit at all. Like, I'll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it'll look up at me and go... I like to lean in and go, "Stop snitchin', motherfucker." And then walk off. 'Cause you're never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don't do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but... My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She's a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family's house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, "Do you know who that is? That's your Uncle John." And I was like, "Oh, my God. That's so sweet. I'm her Uncle John." And then the baby pointed at me and said, "Uncle John has a penis." I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you're supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, "He has a penis"? No, I'm asking, 'cause I don't know what to say in that situation. Here's what I went with that day. I said, "Oh, come on!" I don't know. I thought that'd be good. But then it just made it worse, 'cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, "Do you have a penis?" And I was like, "Yes, I do, but you're a baby, so discretion is key." And then the next day she goes, "He has a penis," and I go, "Oh, come on! Someone can't keep a secret!" Luckily, Jeremy's wife saved the day. The baby's mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, "It's okay. She's just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot." Aren't we all? And, by the way, it would've been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, "She has a vagina," the woman could be like, "Yes, I do, and it's magnificent." And we would all be like, "Hooray! You are brave!" No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.

It's fun to be married. I've never been supervised before. I'm supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She'll be like, "Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him." I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early '80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, "Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don't think they're just blowing off steam." No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, "What do you think you're doing?" But that just meant "Stop." They didn't actually wanna know my thought process. They didn't want me to be like, "Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere." "Oh, well, that's very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?" "Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well... you know how I'm filled with rage? I'm so horny and angry all the time... and I have no outlet for it. So... eggs." Your opinion doesn't matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, "I think Emily Dickinson's a lesbian." And they're like, "Partial credit." And that's a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn't matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, "I don't know," you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that's not fair, 'cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that's not how life works. I'm in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, "Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished." I'd go, "I don't know. Get out of my apartment," you know? But when you're a little kid, you can't say, "I don't know." You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, "I don't know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under." Or if it's one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, "Who's to say?" Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that's the biggest civil rights increase I've seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, "No!" And I went, "All right." And I turned around and left. That's how broken I was.

And there weren't special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It's a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, "Hey, remember when we met in the science building?" They don't even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, "What, who's his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed." What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, "Okay... we got an idea... for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it's about a guy named Marty, and he's very lazy. He's always sleeping late." "Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?" "No. But he does have this best friend who's, you know, a disgraced... nuclear physicist." "I'm confused here. This best friend, this is another student?" "No, no, no. No, this guy's either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don't know how old this guy's supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!" "Okay. I think I see where you're going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination." "Ah! Oh, wow, that's a really good idea, I mean, we didn't even think of that." "All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?" "Well, now I'm embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought... We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom." "I don't know. We thought that'd be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn't get to, he doesn't get to. 'Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad's gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we're gonna imply that a white man wrote 'Johnny B. Goode.' So, we're gonna take that away from 'em." "Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We're gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?" "No, no, no. Back to the Future." "Right, but they go to the past." "Yeah."

Kids have it very good now. My friend's a teacher. She told me that, uh... the parents will take the kids' side over the teacher now. That's insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up... more than they trusted me. I don't mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult's word... was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, "Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick." And my mom would be like, "John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man's dick?" And I would be the only one who's like, "Hey, doesn't anyone wanna know why... his dick was near my biters... in the first place? Isn't anyone curious... as to how I had access?" Don't get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn't like us. We weren't friends. People are now like, "My mom's my best friend." I was like, "Oh, is she a super bad mom?" My parents didn't trust us, and they shouldn't have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, "All right, we're going to a resort, and I've just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm." And we were like, "Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!" "Now, I'm telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm." "Oh, we're gonna freak out so bad!" "Yes, John, you have a question?" "How did he lose his arm?" "That's exactly what you won't ask." And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, "So, how'd you lose your arm?" And he was like, "Well, I was born with only one arm." And I was like, "Nah."

No, my parents loved us. It's just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn't get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, "Hmm, we're not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers." "I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way." My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I'd open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, "What are you doing? Are you watching TV?" And I'd go, "No, man. I'm not watching TV." And the TV wouldn't even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It'd be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, "No, I'm just reading this Yellow Pages."

My dad loved us. He just didn't care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. 'Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, "How much wood can we get on this car... without it catching on fire?" But then the big announcement. "We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you've looked at your minivan and thought, 'Huh! It needs a belt.'" So, we're going on the highway. We've been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald's. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, "McDonald's! McDonald's! McDonald's! McDonald's!" And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald's no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, "Look, it's Pumbaa! Look, it's Timon!" And my dad turned around and said, "Are you going to talk the entire time?" He's my hero.

The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I've been on tour this year... Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It's insane. Yeah, well... All right, don't "whoo" if you're white. It's always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don't go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it's a very good thing. But it's also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I've ever seen a law change because the government is just like, "Fine." You know? I've never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, "Gay people are humans." And they're like, "We'll think about it." But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, "Excuse me." And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they're just like, "Okay, here. Take a little. We'd rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else... blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Those stupid parents. And that's a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We'd be watching Saved by the Bell, we'd be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they'd always hold the joint... The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They'd always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it's a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it's legal, and that is great news. Unless you're a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don't just mean because they're about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers 'cause they're about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don't show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don't let him hang out after he's delivered the Chinese food. And we don't look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we're hanging out with... to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don't give him some of the Chinese food. He's never like, "Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?" And we're like, "Yeah, we're all friends."

What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What's your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah... numbers, the letters of math. I'm sorry to bother you. I don't mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They're a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you're like, "No one look at me or I'll kill myself." And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, "Le volunteer!" And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, "No!" And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like... And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like... And everyone at Navy Pier was like "Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!" And my brother was like, "That's great!" I have had other jobs besides comedy.

I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You're like, "Thank you. No one will ever see me again." And they're like, "Goodbye!" I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had... about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week... because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I'm quoting. Her phone rang and she said, "Hello? Hush!" And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn't know her well enough by then to be like, "Hey, what kind of a person are you?" You know? Who could she have been talking to? "Hello? Hush!" This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, "Mischa, help. I'm doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for 'be quiet' right now." – "Hush!" – "You're promoted."

I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man's game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I'm giving you more description than you need, 'cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don't know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, "Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o'clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg." One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I'm about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I'm quoting, "Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!" And then Mary yelled, "Ooh, ducklings!" To which Mr. Finch replied, "Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack." And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you're me. You're a 22-year-old temp, and you're so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don't know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. "Ah!" "One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!" The rain. "And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!" Now, that's debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point... which was, "Ducklings!" But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality... said, "Ah, too old to be a duckling!" As if to say, "My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don't you see? I'm a duck now. And to prove it... Well, I'll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has... 'Quack, quack.'" And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, "Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, 'Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack'?" He would just be like, "Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me." Like, he'd say something else crazy.

That's the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I'm walking down 31st, there's this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I'm walking towards her. She's smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She's watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision... where she could see little bits of data, like, "Little honky ass," and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I'm quoting, "Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs." Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I'm sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. "Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs." It wasn't like I had paused in front of her and been like, "What should I do with my life?" So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. 'Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn't that the American dream when all's said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, "But I..." This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.

I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don't... Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don't, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn't know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who's a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He's all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he's got these grandpa reading glasses, like, "Hey, I can't do nothing to nobody no more." "Oh, me? I'm just an old, old man. I don't have the appetites." You know? And he's always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.
That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.
And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They're a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, 'cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they're becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, 'cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now... imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night... just being like, "Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?" And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, "Hey, can I walk ya home?" And my mom was like, "Hell, yes." So... This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, "You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer." And I was like, "Thanks, I'm nine." But... her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad's a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, "Get away with anything." Can you imagine how he felt later?
So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, "Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill." And without looking up at her, my dad just says, "Why? It's not like he's gonna remember you." One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, "Fine! I'll go and I'll take John." And I was like, "Hell, yeah." And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. 'Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We'd never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he'd have cool answers to kids' questions. They'd be like, "Governor, what's your favorite food?" And he'd be like, "I don't know, fries?" And we'd be like, "Yay, we eat fries!" I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac... from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date... to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It's actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it's packed with people, the... Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it's packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but... No, no. But, but, but... Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble's wife wasn't even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn't gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he's furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, "You switched the samples!" And Dr. Nichols is like, "Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble." What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, "You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!" Anyway, so it's that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who's Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He'd do fun things where he'd go undercover as a homeless person. And he'd be like, "Oh, what time is the soup?" And they'd be like, "Man, you're Walter Jacobson." He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him... Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you're my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, "This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!" Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton's feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, "Hey, Ellen," 'cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, "Hi, Bill." Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So... she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, "This is my son, John, and he's also going to be president." And I was like, "What the hell are you talking about? I'm not gonna be president." And I know now that I'm definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, "Bird-brained." And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, "Hey, man, I like your button." And I said, "You can do whatever you want forever." And he took my advice. And... it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night... I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like... And I went up to him and I went, "Hey! I'm gonna be a Democrat." "And I'm gonna vote for Bill Clinton." And without looking up at me, my dad just said, "You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair." You know, how you talk to a child. So, here's the end of that story. That was 1992.
Let's flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, "The other shoe just dropped." And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton. Good night, Chicago.
